/**
 * Another iteration towards fast, accurate and complete selection mapping. The
 * previous approach (deprecated-../mapSelectionIndices) utilized selection
 * manipulation (extending and moving with selection.modify) to traverse and map
 * the selection in a way that's consistent with the selection api's native view
 * of the document (only visible characters, no trimmed whitespaces or hidden nodes).
 *
 * This had two caveats:
 * 1- Minor: Some elements stopped selections from extending into or around them.
 *    They could only be selected around with a mouse (or manually setting positions).
 *    This was left unhandled since users can easily intuit around it.
 * 2- Breaking: Manipulating selections for up to thousands of characters queued up
 *    thousands of selection change events to get dispatched after after the task
 *    completed. Luckily, testing large selections on a weak-ish laptop from 2016, I noticed
 *    that even with no selection change listeners, dispatching thousands of UI event tasks
 *    locked up the event loop for several seconds. They were all separate tasks so 
 *    rendering wasn't affected, but running JS was a no go until all the events were dispatched.
 *
 *  After trying (and failing) to stop these events from entering the task queue or
 *  removing them from the task queue, I resigned myself to stepping away from
 *  selection manipulation and instead implemented this hybrid selection/range approach
 *  marrying the selection method and the method I used before that (2. in deprecated/)
 *  of traversing visible nodes using a tree walker (that's where the similarity ends).

/**
 * This approach uses the selection's one of a kind stringifier to get the **rendered**
 * selected text on screen, then traverses visible nodes intersecting with the selection
 * to match each character in the rendered string to the location of its counterpart in the DOM.
 *
 * This is needed because the only inconsistencies between text node values and the rendered
 * text are unintuitive whitespaces/new-lines that exist in the source HTML.
 * Looking at an unedited excerpt from the source HTML of a random MDN page [1],
 * lines are broken and indented in a "legible" way, but disregard the ongoing text nodes
 * that span and include these breaks. Text nodes that are ambivalent to HTML lines except by adding a "\n".
 * While this practice leads to pretty HTML files, that read well and are easy to edit, all while not
 * affecting the final rendered page, they still leak incorrect data into the DOM, in the node values,
 * in the form of those extra whitespace characters [1].
 *
 * These can and should be processed out before shipping but I've encountered them enough times
 * (mainly on article based websites) to have to handle them properly for this extension since
 * they can break unit labels, and amounts i.e. 'US \nDollar' or '100 \n kg' casuing false negatives.
 * 
 *
 * These whitespaces are the only characters that are removed by the selection stringifier,
 * so the concatenated value of all visible text nodes in a selection will the same as the
 * selection string + extra whitespaces. So, we can parse through both, matching characters in
 * one set to their counterpart in the other, and skipping over whitespace characters in the node values 
 * with no counterparts in the rendered text.
 *
 * Finally, the selection stringifier adds new lines when crossing block elements, so we
 * need to account for that too by checking if the next character in the string is a new-line
 * when we iterate over a non-text node.
 *
 * P.S. The reason we can't just remove all new-lines is that we need rendered ones to
 * avoid false positives and/or unrelateed units/amounts being matched together. Also, the issue doesn't
 * only add new-lines, but spaces and tabs that are in the HTML files [1] which also aren't
 * necessarily rendered, but can break the extension's matching.
