***Highlight** a unit, and it'll **convert** it*

# Inspiration
Believe it or not, this was inspired by a tweet. Someone tweeted a picture of Opera GX converting something they highlighted and the official Opera GX twitter account (underrated account) replied to them, thankfully causing it to pop up on my timeline. 

I thought it was a great feature, especially since I enjoy doom-converting to my local sinking currency, and don't enjoy typing out values or searching them in new tabs to convert them, ***so here we are.***

# Experience
This *"quick afternoon project"* (**ha!**) was a great exploration into: 
- üë∑ Planning, structuring and logically interconnecting the various working parts of the extension over 3 independent scripts with different dependencies. 
- ü§ØThoughtful decision making when encountering design and architecture crossroads. (Over **many** decisions).
- üí° Heeding **The Call‚Ñ¢** (AKA inspiration for new features and improving existing implementions).
- üß† Solving difficult and tricky problems in an attempt to heed said call^. 
  - Then later going back and implementing those solutions in completely new and much better ways, while questioning the sanity and life choices of the original author (yours truly).
- üèóÔ∏è Diving deeper into build tools and their underlying strategies (Vite/Rollup & AST based tree shaking üëç)
- üîß Developing custom tooling to imrpove and ease the overall dev experience.
   - Who knows what year this'd release in if I hadn't gotten sick of manually reloading the extension and made a Chrome reload plugin for Rollup (and Webpack before migrating)üôÉ
